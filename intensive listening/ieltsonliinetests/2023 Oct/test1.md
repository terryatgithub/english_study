to begin our topic of sustainable development in south america, 
i'd like to briefly acquaint to you with 6 biomes presented in the country

each of these biomes has its own geographic and environmental features.
has unique resources that people may exploit and 
indeed each facing different threat from human development

biomes, if you recall, are regions that  climatally and geographicall
x: divide and contain distinct communities of plenty of animals 
    defined                                   plants and animals

x: there are some types of name for the plant communities 
   they      sometimes named for
x: and ikesa? just forest, sevana?, and grassland,
   that occur such as       savannah 

x: whether these plants are ever green or disindues
                            evergreen or deciduous
x: the plamatic fators is well, 
   and climatic factors as well
x: for example, tropical, temporate, etc.
                          temperate


alright, let's take a look at this map of Brazil.
the largest biome in Brazil is Amazonian rain forest biome. (31)
which you can see located on the north of the country.

it's one of two rain forest biomes in Brazil
the second being there is Atlantic rain forest biome (32)
which is located in the relatively narrow strip 
x: running up via the Atlantic coast 
              the eastern 

in the very southmost part of Brazil, border(ed) by the Atlantic rain forest,
lies the very samll and relatively unstudy Pampas biome (33) which is grassland


x: finally straighting line back the middle of the country, 
           stretching like a belt across
between the two forest rain(rainforest) biomes, 
lie the Pantanal, the Caatinga and the Cerrado.

starting (at) the left of the map, 
you can see the smallest of the three, which is the Pantanal biome, (34 G)
x: the unique season leaf pandoria(?)
    a  unique seasonally flooded wetland area

in the center of the country is Cerrado(35 E), the second largest biome in Brazil
