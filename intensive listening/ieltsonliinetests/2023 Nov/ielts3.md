## section 2
An investment property is usually at the cheaper end of the market.
People buy an investment property is not to live, but in addtion to their own home. in order to rent it out to other people.

the advantage of putting your savings into property for the future is that you can be pretty certain that as a logn term investment your money will safely increase (in) value in line with inflation.

many people are turning to property investment instead of pensions gains (pension schemes). 
as we heear the horrble stroies taht the country shuch as UK, when people have invested their all longlife to pensions gains, to find out that now their moeny is relatively worthless.

x: house is automatically what it's known as capital gains.
houses automatically own what is known as capital gains.

 that is for every year you own the property, 
it becomes more valuable and often gives the best ratio of interest on your money than most banks do.

however, that is not to say there are no risks. 
there are people who buy property when the market is high, 
and prices are inflated beyond their true value, 
only to find the  house market slows down, diagnosed of negative equity.
they are in a state of negative equity.


negative equity is the situation that arises when you owe more for the house than the house is worth
