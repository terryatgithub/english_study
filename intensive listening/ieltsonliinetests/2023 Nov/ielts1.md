x: hello Dale, how did you get along the shoping enquiries?



x: well i got 50 people to answer questions and the result is quite interesting

ok let's have a look

x: well those were hand out and
you can see the majority people under interview said they went shopping once a week, most often that was the weekend

right 
x: for those people who spent enormous amount of money 
if you see this chart, you can see that half of people spend 45 pounds a month, and while 15% of people spend more than that at an average of 75 pounds. 
the rest spent relatively smaller amount even the regular shopers spend no more than 20 pounds a month.

window shoppers?
yes, i ask them what kind of shops they prefer.
and the response was unanimous everyone went to the department stores
i think that's where young people today want
that sounds understandable and that's a userful statistics i think


x: i also talked them about the things they found most difficult to buy
i thought the answer was going to be something like books or study materials
but it's always cloth
they have problems with things related to hobbies
as far as sportswares is concerned, 
x: they complain about the lack of shop sti salad, not many have trouble buy sweaters things like that, 
but shoes and trousers were really problematic

was that again? because there just isn't enough variaty 
yes they say everywhere they just come across the same styles
x: so they just give up of the word
i know what they mean

x: lastly i ask them who they want to shop with



- part 4: 
can anybody hear me?
is this microphone working? 
x: good, now, welcome everybody to the second of this lectures on successful study at colleage, yesterday we looked into housekeeping issues, where to find information, how to use the library computer system and so on.

x: today we're going to cover issues that are vitally important to you all through out your time here at college. 
and that is time management. 
x: hundreds of books have been written about time management. and those of you who are interested in doing some extra reading on the subject, you are very welcomed to see me after the lecture. as i have a book list here and some other useful materials. 

now time management, 
in the past, this used to mean making a list to plan for every hour of the week and then try to stick to this plan, these days, however, the whole idea of managing time has changed. 
in fact, if you think about it, you will find (that) it is impossible to manage time. it's just goals(goes). 
so what you really need to manage is to manage yourself.

to manage yourself effectively, you need to have a clear idea, both on(of) what you want to achieve and how to achieve it.
in other words, you need to set goals, and you need to move towards achieving these goals in an effecient and systematic way.

most coursework at this(the) college set by this(mid) semester and at the end of (the) semester  usually involves two return(written) assignments between 1500 and 3000 words in length, if you look around (you) at college that you will see during the first week(s) of the term, everyone looks cheerful and focused , followed by a change around week 6, assignment time, when people start to look being(a bit) stressed. the library report(s that an) increasing numbers of students become angry about the books unavailable(when books are not available).

 so what's happened? has everybody become suddenly iretable(irritable) in(and) angry for no reason? not quite. the reason is that people (have) not manage(d) their resources well. they have not set priorities for reaching their goals and as a result, some of them realize they are going to do badly with their assignments. this will not be because (they lack intelligence or love of the subject) of lack of intelligence or love of some object. they will fail because they did not have clear idea of what they have to do. and how long it should take them. 

---
let's step back a minute
x: what do we mean about(by) establishing goals?
well, basicall, it means decide(deciding) what you want to achieve 
in other words, decide(deciding) on the results (that) you want to achieve

the students as(that) i've mentioned find(found) themselves very stressed mainly because they have an assignment to do.
but they do(did) not fully think through the effect (that) this would have on their day to day life.

x: there is no full of spare time in a day. 
there is an awful lot of spare time in a day.

for example if you manage to spend some of that time, even just one hour on an activity that helps you with your study, that 1 hour could have (a) major impact in your course. 
particularly if you make it a regular habit.
i'd like to ask you now to have a look at the planners in your information kits. 

you will see (that) there are 3 
one term planner, one weekly planner and one daily planner. 
x: the term planner is to help you get to know(an) overview 
                                    get an overview 
of everything that you will need to do for the term
the week planner is to help you week by week.
and the daily planner will help you with very(the really) detailed planning.

before we go any further, i would like you to make a note on your daily planner now.
i want you to picture how you could make a major difference in your life, by spending just one hour a day on some activities for the next term.



background reading for example, or preparing your bibliography. 
now imagine the benefit in(at) the end of the term. 
the term diary, and the weekly diary are the most important ones. 

however, a week is really the shortest time you have to establish an overview of your time for planning purposes. 
now you need to set priorities for the term.
work out how you cuold achieve those priorities and the result(s) that you desire

in you can get into the habit of planning like this. 
you will soon find taht oyu will actually have more time than before.
to spend on relaxation and otehr activities taht you enjoy.

now let's share some of ideas that you've come up with
i will divide you (up) into groups to share your ideas.
