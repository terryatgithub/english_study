and the expiry date?
sorry?

next july
now how long would you want the car for? 
twelve days did you say?
no, i only need the car for ten days.
from the 2nd to the living next month.

## section 2
now, what kind(type) of car are you looking to hire?
well, i'm not too worried about the model of the car,
but i understand that you have rent cars for (just) 25$ a day.
is that correct?
we do sometimes at(have) 25$ deals but only in a(the) low season. 
for the period you're looking at, the cheapest we have is 35$.
however, that price includes unlimited kilometers. 

sorry, did you say unlimited kilometers?
what does that mean exactly?
that means no matter how far you go, the cost is the same
some companies charge for rental and then charge again for every kilometer you actually drive,


well, i am going to be travelling quite long distances
i'm visiting relatives, and they live quite far apart from each other.
so unlimited kilometers is(are) probably a(x) good idea.

if you travelling long distances, it would be better of an automatic
changing gear in menu can make it more expensive in petrol
ok, i'll take the automatical thing

right, so that's an automatic car for ten days from the 2nd to the eleventh. 
that's all booked. 

is there anythign else i can help you with?
no, that's fine.
oh sorry, what do i need to bring with me when i pick up the car?

all you need is a(your) driving licence.
well, thank you very much
bye

when thinking about beatiful countryside or stunning views, 
it's long accepted that Australia and New Zealand have few equals

what is perhaps slightly less well-known is what these country can offer 
to the ever premier enthusiast

both countryies have railways which pass through breathe takeing scenary in the other most comfort??

In New Zealand, you can travel from the country's biggest city Auckland to where a third of the popluation lives, its capital Wellington. 
on the longest passenger rail service in the country, the OverLander.
x: crossing 691(681) kilometers, the prime ones ???? wild catal 
    (the train rides through the lush farmland of Waikato)
x: in doctor one way way spirow
    (and up around remove spiral)
onto the amazing vocanical plateau surrounded by native bush


on a clear day, you will be able to see three of New Zealand's most famous 
x: Vacanoes(volcanoes), Manropeho, Norahor, Mantomororo. 
    Mount Ruaperu went Ngauruhoe and linked Tongariro.

The whole journey can be completed in 11 hours.

but for those who came(keen) to see a little more of the country, 
the trip can be extended for(x) over 3 or 4 days.


this gives travelers the oppotuny of seeing the famous white tomb(Waitomo) caves,
x: relaxing in the multiple rousero or skydiving over the 
            mud pools of Rotorua                        Lake Taupo


moving into the sight side, you can take the ??? to the southern 
travelling from the southen 


moving on the South Island, you can take the transalpine to the southern alps.
travelling from the South Pacific Ocean to the Tasman Sea.
climbing from Christchurch right to the Alps.
this 223 kilometers trip is particularly impressive 
as the train passes through 16 tunnels before descending to grayma(Greymouth)
for(at) the end of the line.
taking only 5 hours, this is a relatively short trip
but it is worth noting this journey has been listed as 
x: the six foremost rare routine of the world
listed as the sixth most scenic rail route int th eworld


for those that are not so keen on mountains, the South Island has the second option. the train coastal


with the sea on one side, the mountain on the other, 
again show the best scenary that New Sealand has to offer.

also taking 5 hours, one of the highlight of this journey is the oppotunity for whale watching
the fortunate view(few) of(that) see whales are well rewarded, but there are more common sites which are just enjoyable. such as penguines or seals.


some travelers prefer a longer jouney in South Australia
the India Pacific, for example, which travels from Sydney through to Perth, has been adapted to the adventure of the spans in Australia

with three nine onboard, the trip takes blue mantoon and nolable plains
and as the name implies, the India Pacific shows you two oceans. 

this train too(journey) holds two world records, 
covering 4352 kilometers, it was the world's longest train journey
it also travels the world's longest strange stretch railway track for 470 kilometers

for those who find this distance is a little daunting, 
passengers can stretch their legs in a number of different stops. 
such as Cargolin, famous for gold, 
and broken hill, first found in the single mile
                 first found is a silver mine

x: with three days on board trains, it's a little excessive
if three days on board a train is a little excessive
there are alternatives,

the Ghan, for example, which travels from Adlanden in the south to Alan spreads(springs) in the center of the continent.

passing through Crystal Brook, Potal Gusten, and Rumor, 
this journey gives indications what life was like for the earlier satlist 
as they discovered the country.

along the way, you can also see an ironman sculpture, which was constructed by railway workers to commemory the 1 million(millionth) concrete sleeper laied during the construction of the line.

finally just a quick word about the overland which runs between Melbourne and Adelaide

x: as the first train to travel between the capitals of two states, 
x: it is historic cause one was relaxing went to travel. 
   it is historic as well as relaxing way to travel
x: and it's famous for being the oldest and longest distance train journey in this continent. 
    and is famous for being the oldest long-distance train journey on the continent.

with so many memorable journesy to choose from, the only problem you'll have is knowing which one to do first.
