## Sample Question

Describe a friend who has played an important part in your life. How did you meet this person? What kind of things have you done toghether?

## Sample Answer

Friends play a hugely important role in our lives, and I do my best to maintain good relationships. I have met many amazing people in my life; however, one friend, in particular, has played a bigger role in my life than others and has helped me over many years.

We met while studying abroad in Germany and immediately bonded over our love of football. We played on the same local team in Germany every weekend for at least nine months. We later traveled together, lived together, and even helped to get each other jobs.

Although we can't see each other as often as we would like these days because we live in different countries, we are always chatting online and helping each other with work and personal issues.

I don't know where I would be in life without the love and support of this great friend.
