# answer

## Simple Structure

### 1. open phrase: who did you talk to and what about

I asked my professor a question after class today.
I asked them to explain the concept of cultivating sources as a reporter.

### 2. more details: what were the ideas

They said that it is the process of building relationships with people who can provide information for stories.

One way to do this is by attending events where these people are likely to be and starting conversations with them.

### 3. the outcome: what did you say you were going to do?

Having sources is useful because you can reach out to them for information rather than asking strangers for information.
