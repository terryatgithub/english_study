Explain with reasons and examples.

# Answer

1. Topic sentence
   Voluteering can be an incredibly rewarding experience and I do think it would be a great idea if schools made it mandatory.

2. Supporting sentences
   First of all, most teenagers have other things on their minds, like hanging out with friends. If students have the oppotunity to volunteer, they can learn something new about their community and personality.

I remember when I was in high school I had to go and help a senior citizen out at a local nursing home. I was paired up with an old man named Joe. He didn't speak much, but handled me a book on his bedside and asked me to read it to him. It was Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. He just laid in his bed with his eyes closed. It was strange, and kind of boring at first.
As I continued to read, I noticed how happy he was, just laying there with his eyes closed and listening. I soon lost myself in the story and time flew by.

3. Conclusion sentences
   In the end, I was thankful for the experience and learned to appreciate the little things, like a good book, which is why I definitedly think schools shoud make it mandatory for students to volunteer.
