Talk about the differences between working for a big company and working for a small company. which do you prefer?

# Sample Answer

When choosing a company to work for, there are few things more important to consider than the size of the company.

Typically, big companies offer higher salaries and have a bigger corporate ladder to climb, which could lead to more responsibilities and promotions.

On the other hand, at a small company, an individual can make more of an impact. At small companies, your ideas and hard work have a bigger impact on the long-term success of the company, which can be very rewarding.

These are some differencies between working for a big company and a small one. I definitely want to work for a small company when I graduate from university.
