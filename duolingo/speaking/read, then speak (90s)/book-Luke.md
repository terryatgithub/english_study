# Answer

A book that I've read recently, which really inspired me, was called "Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman" by the famous physicist Richard Feynman.
This books is a collection of personal stories, both hilarious and thought-provoking, from Richard Feynman's life.

This book is mainly about all the life lessons that Dr. Feynman learnt in his amazing life, for instance do things that you love as best as you can.
As this book is a collection of stories from his life rather than a novel, it doesn't really have a plot.
Each chapter covers one important part of his life, such as his time at university or the time he met Albert Einstein, which, in my opinion was the most fascinating chapter.

Turning to next question, the first time I heard of this book was on a podcast where two people were talking about the most influential books they've ever read.
Even though I hadn't heard of Dr. Feynman then, the way they talked about him was amazing. So, as soon as I finished listening to the podcast, I went straight to the bookstore to buy a book.
