# Answer

I recently saw a live performance of Swan Lake at an arts center in London, Where I currntly live.
Swan Lake is a famous ballet where many talented dancers and performers dress in amazing costumes and perform live on stage with a full orchestra.
Even though I don't particularly enjoy ballet, I thoroughly enjoyed this show.

Moving on to the last question, my favorite things about it were the beautiful dancing and how the dedicated cast brought the characters to life on stage. The training, practice, and preparation that must've gone into the show impressed me a lot.

Another thing I enjoyed was the music as it became increasingly dramatic as the show went on, which kept me focused throughout the entire show.

I had such a good time watching this ballet that it has even inspired me to buy more tickets to live shows and experience more art in my spare time.
